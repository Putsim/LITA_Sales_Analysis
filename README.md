### Project Overview
I conducted an in-depth sales data analysis for a retail store in this project to provide actionable insights that drive business decisions. The objective was to explore key metrics such as top-selling products, regional sales performance, and monthly sales trends, culminating in an interactive Power BI dashboard. By leveraging Excel, SQL, and Power BI, I transformed raw sales data into a visual and comprehensive report that highlights the storeâ€™s sales performance.

### Data used:
The dataset used for this analysis is the **"Sales_data.csv"** file, containing detailed information about each sale made. It comprises of 8 columns;
1. Order ID
2. Customer Id
3. Product
4. Region
5. Order Date
6. Quantity
7. Unit Price
8. Total Sales

### Tools Used:
- **Excel**: For initial data exploration and pivot table analysis.
- **SQL**: This is used to query key insights such as top products, regional sales, and revenue trends.
- **Power BI**: This is used to visualize the findings through interactive dashboards.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing variables.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
In this project, I analyzed the sales performance of a retail store by exploring key metrics such as **top-selling products**, **regional sales performance**, and **monthly trends**. The analysis follows three stages:

**1. Excel Analysis:**

The first step involved understanding the structure of the sales dataset and performing basic exploration using pivot tables and Excel formulas. This helped in revealing initial patterns and trends.

 - **Pivot Tables:**
   - **Summarize Total Sales by Product, Region, and Month:** Pivot tables provided an overview of how different products, regions, and periods (monthly) contributed to overall sales.
     
   - **Product Performance:** Total sales were broken down by product, highlighting which items are top-sellers.
     
   - **Regional Sales Trends:** Insights into which regions performed best and which are lagging.
     
   - **Monthly Sales Trends:** Identified seasonal fluctuations and monthly performance trends.
     
- **Formulas for Key Metrics:**
   - **Average Sales per Product:** This helped identify products that have consistent sales performance versus those with large fluctuations.
     
   - **Total Revenue by Region:** Calculates total income generated from each region, giving insight into geographic contributions.

**2. SQL Queries:**

The dataset was loaded into an SQL Server environment, structured queries were used to extract more detailed insights. 
- **Total Sales by Product Category:** This helped identify which categories are driving sales the most.
  
- **Sales Transactions by Region:** Provided a count of how many transactions are occurring in each region, reflecting customer activity levels.
  
- **Highest-Selling Product:** A query to determine which product has the highest sales value overall.
  
- **Total Revenue per Product:** Calculated how much revenue each product has generated, helping to compare the top-selling items.
  
- **Monthly Sales Totals for the Current Year:** Offered a view of how sales are trending month over month.
  
- **Top 5 Customers by Total Purchase Amount:** Identified the most valuable customers.
  
- **Regional Contribution to Total Sales:** Calculated the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.
  
- **Products with No Sales in the Last Quarter:** Flags products that have experienced a drop in sales, highlighting areas of concern.

**3. Power BI Dashboard:**

I translated these findings into a user-friendly and interactive dashboard.
- **Sales Overview:** Displays total sales, revenue trends, and comparisons of key metrics.
  
- **Top-Performing Products:** Visualizes which products generate the most revenue and sales volume.
  
- **Regional Breakdown:** A geographic visualization showing which regions are the most and least profitable.
  
- **Monthly Sales Trends:** Interactive charts displaying monthly sales fluctuations, helping spot trends and seasonal variations.

### Data Analysis
- _**Total sales for each product category**_
```SQL
SELECT Product, SUM(Total_Sales) AS TotalSales
FROM [dbo].[SalesData]
GROUP BY Product;
```

- _**Number of sales transactions in each region**_
```SQL
SELECT Region, COUNT(OrderID) AS NumberOfTransactions
FROM [dbo].[SalesData]
GROUP BY Region;
```

- _**Highest selling product by total sales value**_
```SQL
SELECT TOP 1 Product, SUM(Total_Sales) AS TotalSales
FROM [dbo].[SalesData]
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
```

- _**Total Revenue by product**_
``` SQL
SELECT Product, SUM(Total_Sales) AS TotalRevenue
FROM [dbo].[SalesData]
GROUP BY Product;
```

- _**Monthly Sales Total for the current year**_
```SQL
SELECT 
    MONTH(OrderDate) AS Month, 
    SUM(Total_Sales) AS MonthlySales
FROM [dbo].[SalesData]
WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = YEAR(GETDATE()) 
GROUP BY MONTH(OrderDate);
```

- _**Top 5 customers by total purchase amount**_
```SQL
SELECT TOP 5 Customer_Id, SUM(Total_Sales) AS TotalPurchase
FROM [dbo].[SalesData]
GROUP BY Customer_Id
ORDER BY TotalPurchase DESC
```

- _**Percentage of Total Sales contributed by each region**_
```SQL
WITH TotalSalesCTE AS (
    SELECT SUM(Total_Sales) AS TotalSalesAmount 
    FROM [dbo].[SalesData]
)
SELECT 
    Region, 
    SUM(Total_Sales) AS RegionSales, 
    (SUM(Total_Sales) * 100.0 / (SELECT TotalSalesAmount FROM TotalSalesCTE)) AS PercentageContribution
FROM [dbo].[SalesData]
GROUP BY Region;
```

- _**Identify products with no sales in the last quarter**_
```SQL
SELECT Product
FROM [dbo].[SalesData]
GROUP BY Product
HAVING MAX(OrderDate) < DATEADD(QUARTER, -1, GETDATE());
```

- _**Average Sales per product**_
```Excel
=AVERAGEIF(Table1[Product],"Shirt",Table1[Total Sales])
```

- _**Total Revenue by region**_
```Excel
=SUMIF(Table1[Region],"North",Table1[Total Sales])
```

- _**Average Sales per Product**_
```DAX
 = Average(SalesData[Total Sales])
```
